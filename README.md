Final Project: Customer Churn Prediction
Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model for the telecom operator Interconnect to forecast customer churn. If a customer is likely to leave, the company can proactively offer them promotions or special plans to retain them.

Context:
Interconnect provides landline and internet services along with additional offerings such as antivirus, tech support, cloud storage, and streaming services. Customers can choose monthly plans or longer contracts. The dataset combines contract, personal, internet, and phone service details for each customer.

Goal:
Using this data, we will:

Explore and understand the data.
Engineer and prepare features.
Train and evaluate models.
Optimize our model for the AUC-ROC metric as the main performance measure.
Provide insights to help the business understand churn drivers.
The final deliverable is a trained model that can classify whether a customer will churn (EndDate != 'No') or not.
